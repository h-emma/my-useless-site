# Code Review

1: On line 1 in index.js you could maybe name the array of Christmas greetings  “greetings”? Just to make it more clear in the functions what you are calling on. But that’s a minor detail and nothing that effects the code. 

2: Great comments on the javascript! Makes it much easier to read the code when you have an explanation of what it actually does. 

3: on line 19 in index.html the word Christmas is misspelled. Also on line 29 and 43. That might be on purpose though. It doesn’t effect the code in any way, just a heads up if it’s something you’ve overlooked.

4: the css with the media-queries. Good idea to have it all in one file, but maybe write out the entire name? Just  so that you don’t confuse it with different types of media (videos, images, sounds) and let others be able to find it quickly. But all in all! Nicely organised project! Everything is easy to find. 

5: You remembered alt-text and labels! Great!
